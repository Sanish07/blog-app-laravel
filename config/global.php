Melt the butter over very low heat so you don't loose any moisture and then cool to room temp. In a bowl, whisk the cooled melted butter and sugars together until light and fluffy. Add the egg and whisk until combined. Stir in the vanilla with a wooden spoon or spatula. With the same spoon/spatula, stir in the dry ingredients until just barely combined; some streaks of flour are okay. Stir in the chocolate chips. At this point there should be no visible flour streaks. Scoop cookie dough onto a tray or plate with a 1.25 ounce cookie dough scoop (or make 1.5 tablespoon balls). Cover with plastic wrap and place in the fridge for 30 minutes. You can also freeze these guys and bake from frozen, adding a couple of extra minutes. When it's time to bake, heat the oven to 375°F and arrange cookie dough on parchment paper line baking trays, leaving 2-3 inches between each cookie. Sprinkle with with flaky sea salt and bake until the tops are cracked and lightly golden, 10-12 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through. Cool on the pan, and enjoy!"

        ['id' => 2,'cat' => 'tech','title' => "Quantum Computing - The Breakthrough",'body' => "Quantum computing is a sophisticated approach to making parallel calculations, using the physics that governs subatomic particles to replace the more simplistic transistors in today's computers. Quantum computers calculate using qubits, computing units that can be on, off or any value between, instead of the bits in traditional computers that are either on or off, one or zero. The qubit's ability to live in the in-between state — called superposition — adds a powerful capability to the computing equation, making quantum computers superior for some kinds of math. Using qubits, quantum computers could buzz through calculations that would take classical computers a loooong time — if they could even finish them.
         For example, today's computers use eight bits to represent any number between 0 and 255. Thanks to features like superposition, a quantum computer can use eight qubits to represent every number between 0 and 255, simultaneously. It's a feature like parallelism in computing: All possibilities are computed at once rather than sequentially, providing tremendous speedups. So, while a classical computer steps through long division calculations one at a time to factor a humongous number, a quantum computer can get the answer in a single step. Boom! That means quantum computers could reshape whole fields, like cryptography, that are based on factoring what are today impossibly large numbers."

Originally in Telugu, this  Allu Arjun starrer has accumulated a staggering profit of  Rs 40 crores in its dubbed Hindi version. If the film had not gone to Amazon Prime this week, 'Pushpa The Rise' would have shown no fall in its box office figures despite the new wave of the Covid pandemic. What is it that pulled the multitudes out of the relative safety of their homes to the high-risk zone of movie theatres? Trade knowledgeable kick in with their opinion. Taran  Adarsh(trade guru): “Pandemic era…Non-holiday release (one week before Christmas) ….Tough opponents (SpiderMan in Week 1; 83 in Week 2)…Minimal promotions + limited screens/shows… Normal ticket pricing [not enhanced rates]. Pushpa braves it all...What made it so successful?  Several factors, in my opinion. One is Allu Arjun's popularity and rich fanbase in the Hindi market thanks to the dubbed versions available on YouTube and satellite channels. Two, the wholesome content it offers. Complete masala entertainer. Three, weak opposition in '83' gave 'Pushpa' ample breathing space to fly high. '83' appealed more to the metros, but 'Pushpa', with its wholesome content, appealed to metros as well as Tier 2 and Tier 3 belts. With regional language dubs the norm for years on Hindi movie channels, plus access to masala films from the South through OTT/Internet, language is seemingly no more the issue. Pushpa’s incredible, sleeper success proves the pan-India Baahubali was not a fluke!” "

Like in many countries, the flower blossoming marks the arrival of warmer weather and the upcoming season is very much embraced by everyone. The best time to view the beautiful pink colors in Japan is somewhere between March and May, depending on the location and the weather circumstances. On average, the blooming period only lasts for two weeks. Usually the cherry blossoms start blooming from south to north. The Kanto, Kansai and Kyushu regions tend to be the earliest to start while the Tohoku region and Hokkaido are the latest. There are also different types of sakura trees that bloom earlier, such as kawazu sakura in Shizuoka that usually start to bloom at the end of February. In Japan, sakura viewing is immensely popular; each year millions of people set out to watch the blossoming cherry trees in their full color. To Japanese people, sakura symbolize spring, hope, beauty and new life and the beautiful sakura flowers have made it into art and poetry, as well as food and drink among other things. In particular, the Japanese see the cherry blossoms' brevity(many only bloom for a week or two) as a symbol of the impermanence and transience of life. It also marks the beginning of the school and fiscal year, both starting in April, thus spring is a season full of new meetings, activities, and liveliness. Other than these deeper meanings behind sakura, the cherry trees in full bloom are simply an amazing sight to witness!"

He superkicked Jungle Boy in the closing segment of the pay-per-view and now plans on proving himself superior to Bryan Danielson, who debuted immediately after Cole. Cole and Danielson spent the majority of All Out together, patiently awaiting their chance to shake up the pro wrestling industry. “I didn't even fly into Chicago [the site of All Out], I flew into a different city the day before,” Cole says, noting that he was thrilled to wear his mask to help hide his appearance on the flight. “I didn't even stay in the same hotel as Bryan. We showed up to the building while the show was going on, and we waited outside in a trailer. The locker room didn't even know until the absolute last moment. It was the most secretive debut I’ve ever been involved in, and Tony Khan took every measure to make this as big of a surprise as possible.” “There is so much story for us to tell, especially with Kenny Omega and the Bucks involved,” Cole says. “There are so many different directions for us to go, and it's going to be very exciting with the way we tell this story. I've changed a lot since I've been with The Elite, and so have Kenny and the Bucks, and it's going to be really exciting to create what we're about to create.”"

Today, after building upon those foundational experiments, machine learning is more complex. While machine learning algorithms have been around for a long time, the ability to apply complex algorithms to big data applications more rapidly and effectively is a more recent development. Being able to do these things with some degree of sophistication can set a company ahead of its competitors. Most data scientists are at least familiar with how R and Python programming languages are used for machine learning, but of course, there are plenty of other language possibilities as well, depending on the type of model or project needs. Machine learning and AI tools are often software libraries, toolkits, or suites that aid in executing tasks. However, because of its widespread support and multitude of libraries to choose from, Python is considered the most popular programming language for machine learning. Supported algorithms in Python include classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. Though Python is the leading language in machine learning, there are several others that are very popular. Because some ML applications use models written in different languages, tools like machine learning operations (MLOps) can be particularly helpful."

Some swear by vitamin C-rich orange juice for warding off disease. Although the evidence about vitamin C's illness-fighting powers is conflicting, there's no doubt that it's still a good nutrient to consume. Since the body does not produce vitamin C, you must obtain it from outside sources to create and repair skin cells and fight off the effects of damaging free radicals. If you eat your veggies, though, it's not hard to reach your daily quota, since all fruits and vegetables contain vitamin C to some degree. That's right; orange juice isn't your only option for getting this important nutrient! Which type of produce will deliver the highest amount of vitamin C per serving: Red bell peppers, broccoli, kiwi, or oranges? One serving of red bell pepper delivers a whopping 190 mg of vitamin C! Broccoli contains 132 mg, kiwi boasts 137 mg, and oranges come in last with 83 mg. According to the National Institutes of Health, the daily recommended value for vitamin C is 90 mg for men and 75 mg for women, so one serving of red bell pepper will more than cover your needs. The next time you feel a cold coming on, munch on some peppers instead of reaching for the orange juice! (In case you're wondering, 8 ounces of orange juice has 137 mg of vitamin C—but you're better off choosing a whole fruit, veggie, or mean green juice instead for more fiber and less sugar.)"

          ['id' => 9,'cat' => 'sports','title' => "Wayne Rooney's Untold Stories",'body' => "According to English publication 'The Daily Mail', Rooney isn't the terrible character that the press would have us believe, with them citing several stories that paint the striker in a more positive light. One such story is that Rooney once personally approached a shy young autograph hunter who appeared too scared to approach his idol. The story goes that the then 24-year-old Rooney asked the youngster if he could sign his autograph book, before asking for a photo with the youngster. The former England man was allegedly the only Manchester United player past or present, apart from the great Sir Bobby Charlton, to get in touch with the family of world Cup winner Nobby Stiles when it was revealed that he was struggling with Alzheimer's disease. Rooney sent the midfielder, whose dance with the Jules Rimet trophy in hand is etched into the memories of football fans of a certain age, a hand-written card explaining how much he had enjoyed watching videos of Stiles play and expressing his sadness at hearing of his struggles. Rooney was also heavily involved in charitable movements and it was reportedly Rooney himself that devised a way of ensuring that more players could make visits to sick children in local hospitals around Christmas and to ensure that more substantial gifts could be distributed. Though perhaps the most touching story is from when Rooney was just 21, according to Tony Coton's autobiography 'There to be shot at', the club were out celebrating their 2007 title win when the striker struck up a conversation with goalkeeping coach Coton and first-team coach Mike Phelan. “Another one for the collection, hey, lads?” Rooney joked, only to be told about a policy put in place by Club Secretary Ken Merrett that saw club staff receive a cash payment of a few hundred pounds rather than a medal which would cost the club £1,000 each. Rooney was furious, “When we told him about Mr Merrett’s medal policy he was outraged,” Coton recalls, “He couldn’t believe that a club like Manchester United could be so small‑time when it came to sharing out the spoils.” When the pair returned to United's Carrington training base for pre-season, there were packages waiting, with each one containing a solid silver replica of the Premier League trophy worth around £5,000, courtesy of Wayne Rooney. “We were stunned,” Coton explains. “They are absolutely beautiful pieces of work. But for me, their real value isn’t measured in monetary terms. It is the fact they were commissioned by Wayne that makes them so precious.” Rooney stepped up where Sir Alex Ferguson and David Gill failed on this occasion. These are just a few of the tales about Rooney's good side. So, whilst stories about Rooney's excessive drinking, gambling debts and penchant for company of a certain age were the ones that made the headlines maybe, just maybe, the former England international did plenty of good things behind the scenes that we as onlookers were simply never aware of."
